Task 1: Vanilla JavaScript sprite animation techniques
  We animated a dog from a sprite sheet to stand, jump/land, run, feel dizzy, roll, sit, bite, fall and get hit. We followed a YouTube tutorial, that taught how to divide columns from a spritesheet and to use them to animate. The most complex thing to create was to make it possible for changing the animation (for example from stand to run) without having to manually change the code. 


Task 4: Collision animations from a sprite sheet
Much as the task 1, collision animation/task 4 taught how to divide a sprite sheet into squares/columns and how to create an animation loop. The most challenging part was to make the first frame to spawn in a random angle, so that the animations won't be identical. Totally new was to connect the animation with a sound and how to make it work.
