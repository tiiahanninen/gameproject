Project 1: Vanilla JavaScript sprite animation techniques
  We animated a dog from a sprite sheet to stand, jump/land, run, feel dizzy, roll, sit, bite, fall and get hit. We followed a YouTube tutorial, that taught how to divide columns from a spritesheet and to use them to animate. The most complex thing to create was to make it possible for changing the animation (for example from stand to run) without having to manually change the code.
